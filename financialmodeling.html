        In the realm of high-stakes mergers and acquisitions, 
        where every dollar counts, my Corporate Finance course group was tasked with creating a fair price for LVMH's potential 
        acquisition of Tiffany & Co. 
        The recommendated price is based on a comprehensive valuation analysis, including Comparable Companies, 
        Precedent Transactions, Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), and Leveraged Buyout (LBO) analysis methodologies.

        To begin the various analysis methodologies, we needed to produce Assumptions on Tiffany & Co.'s growth for the 
        Base Case and Synergy Case. The Assumptions included projecting revenue growth projected for each main region for the 
        next 3 years. Below is the Synergy Case Financials and Assumptions example:

        For the LBO, I first established the Sources & Uses of funds, then created a Debt Paydown Schedule for the transactions, and finally 
        found a purchase prices that would given fit within the desired 20-25% range for the Internal Rate of Return. Those 
        prices were $71.99 and $67.49, respectively.

        Armed with a comprehensive valuation analysis, we crafted our final report and recommendation: 
        LVMH should initiate negotiations with Tiffany & Co., proposing a purchase price of <strong>$133.00 per share</strong>â€”a figure 
        that encapsulated both the company's intrinsic value and the strategic synergies that will be created.

        My teammates <strong>George Bader, Willian Silva, Ekaterina Vanurina, and Justin Weiss</strong> completed the WACC Analysis, Comparable Companies, Precedent Transactions, Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). 
        Collaborating together, we reviewed all of the evealution methods, explained out decisions, and taught to others what we learned throughout the process.
