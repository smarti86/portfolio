        CUR8, a carbon removal brokerage with a bold mission to eradicate 1 billion 
        tonnes of carbon annually, faced a challenge: its lack of a purchasing process was
        slowing their noble cause. The existing over-the-phone portfolio creation 
        method slowed down customer acquisition, leading to a pressing need for a 
        streamlined solution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After discussing with my team--Angie Osei-Ampadu, Joyce Li, 
        and Ashley Cai--the mission was clear: simplify the process and empower users 
        to purchase carbon removal portfolios directly from the CUR8 website.

        Starting our journey, we delved into a competitive analysis, seeking 
        inspiration from industry leaders like Lune and Frontier. By dissecting 
        their approaches and referencing CUR8's objectives, we identified their 
        current competitive advantage in the purchase flow process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://lune.co/">Lune's</a> sectioned journey to curate carbon credit portfolios</li>
          <li> <a href="https://frontierccus.com/">Frontier's</a> portfolio breakdown and projects details</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Our peers and TAs also gave us feedback on our low-fidelity mockup. With their help, we
        added a feature for stakeholder collaboration for an intuitive, frictionless purchasing flow.
        With these insights, we embarked on a journey of innovation and design.

        Our design iterations began with independent sketches, resulting in eight 
        distinct flows. These are two examples, the first being my own:

      <P>
        For our first iteration wireframing: <br>We consolidated our ideas, focusing on 4 essential pages:
        portfolio summary, cart, and confirmation. 
      </p>  
      <img class="competitive-analysis-table" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-05-09 at 9.00.48 PM.png" alt="Competitive Analysis Table">
      <p>
      For our second iteration wireframing: <br>Feedback from CUR8 and peers guided our design decisions, leading to adjustments like adding back 
        buttons for usability and adding a feature for stakeholder collaboration. 
      </p>
      <img class="competitive-analysis-table" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-05-09 at 9.05.57 PM.png" alt="Competitive Analysis Table">
       <p>
        For our last iteration wireframing: Focusing solely on payment pages that I developed, 
        users review their portfolio and proceed to the purchase request page. If stakeholders 
        weren't previously invited, a banner alert prompts users to do so. Upon submission, 
        users receive a confirmation message to return to their portfolio or exit.
      </p>
      <img class="competitive-analysis-table" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-05-09 at 9.06.57 PM.png" alt="Competitive Analysis Table">
      <p>
        From these diverse blueprints, we crafted wireframes, refining our ideas into tangible prototypes. 
        Iteration by iteration, we honed our designs, focusing on pivotal pages like portfolio summaries, 
        carts, and confirmations. Each iteration brought us closer to our vision of a frictionless journey 
        for CUR8's customers.

        Our final design comprised a cohesive purchasing flow tailored 
        to CUR8's requirements. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The flow seamlessly guided users through project 
        selection, stakeholder collaboration, and purchase request submission. 
        Features like project breakdowns, stakeholder feedback, and a receipt-like 
        review page enhanced user understanding and engagement. By aligning with 
        CUR8's brand identity and providing a user-friendly experience, our solution 
        aimed to streamline the carbon removal portfolio purchasing process.
