        The problem I set out to solve was the frustrating experience
        users often face when shopping for t-shirts and tees online.
        Many existing websites lack intuitive filtering and sorting 
        options, leading to a cluttered and inefficient shopping journey.
        Recognizing the need for a solution that prioritizes simplicity 
        and functionality, I aimed to create a platform that would streamline
        the online shopping experience for users.

        My research involved conducting a thorough competitive analysis of 
        three prominent websites: Zara, Redbubble, and Not On The High Street. 
        Through this research, I gained valuable insights into the filtering, sorting, 
        and aggregation features that resonated with users. My target audience comprised 
        individuals seeking quality t-shirts and tees online, who valued ease of 
        navigation and personalized shopping experiences.

        My design process was iterative, guided by insights from my research and user-centric 
        principles. I explored various filtering and sorting options, considering the tradeoffs 
        between complexity and usability. Iterating on my designs, I strategically prioritized 
        essential features such as size, color, and price filtering, while minimizing visual 
        clutter and maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. Despite being constrained by assignment 
        guidelines, I remained adaptable, ensuring my design met both user needs and project requirements.
